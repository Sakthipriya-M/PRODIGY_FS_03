PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Excited to announce the successful completion of Task-03 during my full stack web development internship at Prodigy InfoTech ðŸš€. the project involved creating a local store e-commerce platform.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Create an e-commerce website for a local store in your area, enabling customers to browse and purchase products online. The platform should feature product listings with images, descriptions, prices, and a shopping cart functionality.

ABOUT PROJECT:

Creating an e-commerce website involves designing and developing a platform where customers can browse and purchase products online. The task includes setting up a user-friendly interface for product listings, a shopping cart, and a secure checkout process. Key components of the site are product images, descriptions, prices, and interactive elements like "Add to Cart" buttons.
The provided coding example uses a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, along with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back-end. The HTML and CSS handle the structure and styling of the website, while JavaScript manages dynamic content and interactions. The back-end code in Node.js sets up a server, connects to a MongoDB database, and provides API endpoints for fetching products and managing the shopping cart.
